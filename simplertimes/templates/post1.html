    <h1>Simpler things</h1>

        I'm a 46 years old programmer. I came from a world where things were simpler.
    </p>
    <p>
        When I started my career there were only a couple of tools and different jobs in this sector. If you learnt C,
        COBOL, Pascal and Assembler you could work in almost every position. Java was a cutting-edge technology when it
        was
        launched
    </p>

        I was working in IT for more than fifteen years, but a couple of years ago I started to work as a teacher after
        two
        years of being a bank cashier. All that time I've been trying to keep my knowledge up-to-date in web development
        (the branch I was specialized in) but it's almost an impossible task. Technology is developing at an exponential
        rate and is difficult to have a base knowledge of the more relevant tools and practices.

        As I want to work in development again, I'll start some projects, make some experiments and take some courses to
        explore where could I go now. My goal for the next years is to work from home with flexible schedule and earn
        200k
        euros per year.I think is a very ambitious goal, but I'll keep it in mind and will see where I can arrive.

        I'll start with this blog. What did we do in simpler times when somebody needed a blog?: a static page. Let's
        build
        one.
